  
While doing this project, I noticed how much different it was going to be for me since I have a PC and everyone else has a Mac. While 
watching my classmates use mallat I realized how much easier it was for them. Since I am using a PC, I knew it would be a little more 
difficult processing a certain amount of topics, so I was very cautious on the amount of topics I used.
