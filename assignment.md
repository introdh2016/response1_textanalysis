Corpus: We will be using [JStor Data for Research](http://about.jstor.org/service/data-for-research).

Downloading Data: Visit [here](fr.jstor.org). Set up an account and select your data of choice. Select Data Type: Citations Online and Word Counts and Output Format: CSV.  If the data has more than 1000 records, there are two options. You can make several requests for data to capture all the data or you need to select a subset. If you do not, you will get a random generated subset from JStor. Once you have the data, please email me. The data will need to be processed and we are using Andrew Goldstoneâ€™s [Count2Text](https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis/blob/master/count2txt) technique on GitHub.  If you are comfortable, feel free to do it yourself!



Response: The 500-1500 word response should explain your data set, your initial findings, and how you would go about further exploring the data set. It should address also address the following questions:
- Why the number of topics? 
- What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us?
- How would you go about further exploring these findings/ arguments?
- What are the possibilities and limitations of topic modeling?


1. Post your response to our GitHub page. 
2. We are going to do a modified citation format since citations will be drawing from our course readings. Make sure to site relevant readings in-text/ parenthetical citation formated like this: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012)
