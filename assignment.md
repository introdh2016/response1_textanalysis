# Response 

The 500-1500 word response should explain the data set, the initial findings, and how one would go about further exploring the data set/ findings/ arguments. It should  also address the following questions:
- Why the number of topics? 
- What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us?
- What are the possibilities and limitations of topic modeling?

More details:

- Post your response to your branch inside the [ Text Analysis Response GitHub repository](https://github.com/introdh2016/response1_textanalysis).

# Corpus

## Jstor
[JStor Data for Research](http://about.jstor.org/service/data-for-research) provides machine-readable data from JStor, a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources.

## Downloading Data

Visit [here](fr.jstor.org). Set up an account and select your data. Select Data Type: "Citations Only" and "Word Counts" and Output Format: "CSV".  If the data has more than 1000 records, there are two options. You can make several requests to capture all the data or you need to select a subset. If you do not, you will get a random generated subset from JStor.

## 
Once you have the data, please email me. The data will need to be processed and we are using Andrew Goldstoneâ€™s [Count2Text](https://github.com/agoldst/dfr-analysis/blob/master/count2txt) technique on GitHub.  If you are comfortable, feel free to do it yourself!
